    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \begin{enumerate}
            \item Describe a mechanism for enforcing memory protection in order to prevent a program
            from modifying the memory associated with other programs.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Dynamic tainting: Durind dynamic memory allocation, 
                both the memory and the corresponding pointer are 'tainted' using the same 
                'taint mark'. Taint marks are then suitably propagated while the program 
                executes and are checked every time a memory address m is accessed through 
                a pointer p; if the taint marks associated with m and p differ, the 
                execution is stopped and the illegal access is reported.
                \item Paged virtual memory: Given an application, unallocated pages and pages allocated to any other application, do not have
                any addresses from the application point of view. Every memory address either points to a page allocated to that 
                application, or generates an interrupt called a page fault. 


            \end{itemize}


\item While memory protection is necessary, there are several examples where programs
require memory to be shared between them. Please give two such examples.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shared memory facilitates inter-process communication (IPC), i.e. a way of exchanging data between programs running at the same time.
    One process will create an area in RAM which other processes can access.
    \item Shared memory can be used to conserve memory space by directing accesses to copies of a piece of data to a
    single instance instead.
\end{itemize}

        \item Please study the PCB (Process Control Block) structure of a Linux system from any reliable
        Internet source. Describe any 10+ fields in the PCB of a process in the latest Linux Operating
        System. Please cite your source as well like in question 2.
